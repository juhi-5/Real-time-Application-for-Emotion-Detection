# Real-time-Application-for-Emotion-Detection
This project aims to classify human emotions from facial expression images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset and predicts one of seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.

Setup Instructions:

1. Downloading Dataset and files: 
Download the repository and unzip it.
The dataset used is [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013), which contains 48x48 grayscale images categorized into 7 emotions. The dataset is structured in subdirectories for training and test data.

2. Install Dependencies: 
Ensure you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed as per given in requirements.txt file.

3. Running the Model: 
Jupyter Notebook: Open and run the emotion-detection notebook.

Kaggle Kernel: Upload the notebook and dataset to your Kaggle account. Ensure the paths in the notebook match the dataset location on Kaggle. Run the notebook directly on the Kaggle platform.

4. Using GUI Use gui.py file to upload image thereafter predicting the emotion.
